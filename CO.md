Addressing Modes – The term addressing modes refers 

to the way in which the operand of an instruction is 

specified. The addressing mode specifies a rule for 

interpreting or modifying the address field of the 

instruction before the operand is actually executed.

Various Addressing Modes:

 Immediate addressing mode: In this mode data is 

present in address field of instruction using # 

symbol. It is designed like one address instruction 

format.

Example: MOVE #200, R1

 Register mode: In register addressing the operand is 

placed in one of 8 bit or 16 bit general purpose 

registers. The data is in the register that is specified 

by the instruction.
